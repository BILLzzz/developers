            <h2>Basics</h2>
            <p>The feed is hosted at Amazon in Ireland and there is no limt  on how often you download it. But generally we recommend you to use some kind of caching layer mostly so that the user does not have to wait for the server to download the feed at every request.</p>
            <p>We try to input caching in the samples as well as far as possible we describe other caching solution as well. How long you do want to cache is completely op to you, but keep in mind that the reviews, trustscore evt. does only update as often as you do. So caching to long will result in the data not being updated often enough, and to often result in poor performance for the user.</p>
            <p>An sample feed can be download from here <a href="http://s.trustpilot.com/tpelements/917278/f.json.gz" target="_blank">http://s.trustpilot.com/tpelements/917278/f.json.gz</a>. This feed is for the demo webshop www.demoshop.com. You can see the reviews on this domain here <a href="http://www.trustpilot.com/review/demoshop.com" target="_blank">Demoshop reviews</a>  and you are also welcome to create more reviews on this site as it is for demo usage only.</p>
            
            <h3>Making it move with jQuery</h3>
            <p>Some would maybe like their own plugin to be animated. We've decided not to include any examples of JavaScript animations in our documentation. Instead we can refer to our Showcases section, where you may be able to see real world examples of moving Trustpilot integrations.</p>
            <p>We will, however, recommend you to use a JavaScript framework like <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> (or any other framework), that have great documentation, to achieve the wished animations of your plugin. You can use jQuery methods like <code>animate()</code>, <code>slideUp</code>, <code>slideDown()</code>, <code>fadeIn()</code> or <code>fadeOut()</code> to get the exact behavior that you may want. There is a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/">full list</a> of effects over at the jQuery documentation.</p>

            <p>If you want to show your Trustpilot reviews on our webpage the widget is a great and easy way of showing them.

For that reason Trustpilot also provide a <a href="#jsondoc">JSON feed</a> with the same information as the widget just in JSON format. This feed can be used to build the same widget and just for the propose of getting SEO for the reviews or it can be used for building a widget that support you design the way you thing it will best support your business. </p>

            <h2>C# .NET Sample</h2>
            <p>Here is an sample of how to download the JSON feed and parsing it to an set of models in C# .NET. </p>
			<p>The sample uses System.Web.Caching for caching the result as this is highly recommende to use some kind of cache. Caching in this situation makes sure that the user does not have to wait for the server to download the feed and parse it every time. </p>
			<p>
			There is several other way of doing this caching, one way could be just to download the feed and save it to local disk, and then every ones in a will download the file again. 
			You could also parse this to you database and then get the data from there at every request. 
			In all cases it could be an good idea to have an service running in the background that does fetch and parse (if need) the feed. This has the advantage that the user never has to wait for the data to download and parse. This is how ever not necessary as the feed normally is not bigger then 3-4KB.
			</p>
			<p>
			If the FeedModel is not in the cache the code downloads the feed directly from the server. It then deserializes the string downloaded to an the FeedModel created for the purpose.
			The FeedModel can then be used to show the data in the frontend.
